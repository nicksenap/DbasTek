\section{Problem 1}
Consider the following schema:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Person(\textbf{id},name,address)
    \item Student(\textbf{id})
    \item Teacher(\textbf{id}, office)
    \item Course(\textbf{cid}, name, teacherId)
    \item Takes(\textbf{id}, \textbf{cid}, grade)
    \item Requires(\textbf{cid}, requiredCid)
\end{itemize}
Where primary keys are in bold and id in Student and Teacher are foreign keys of Person, id in Takes is a foreign key of Student, teacherId in Course is a foreign key of Teacher, cid in Takes and Requires is a foreign key of Course, and finally requiredCid is a foreign key of Course.
\\ \\
Answer at least 2 of the following queries in relational algebra:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a. Names of all the students
    \item b. Name of the teacher teaching the course with id DD1368
    \item c. Names of the students taking the course with id DD1368
\end{itemize}
\newpage 
\subsection{Solution}
a. Names of all the students:
    \begin{center}
        $\Pi_{name}(Student)$
    \end{center}
We use \textit{Selection} to select the name column of Student.
\\ \\
b. Name of the teacher teaching the course with id DD1368
\\ \\
c. Names of the students taking the course with id DD1368
    \begin{center}
    $\Pi_{name}(\sigma_{\Pi_{id}(\sigma_{\Pi_{cid}(\sigma_{DD1368}(Course))}(Takes))}(Person))$
    \end{center}
We use \textit{Project}
